# dame
A C++ implementation of a standard 10x10 dame game.

The motivation of the project was derived from AlphaGo's success in defeating humans in the board game Go.
The long term goal is to have a working AI similar to AlphaGo that can play human experts and win. In the short term, my focus is to get a working AI that can play humans (or itself) and learn by simulating millions of games.

While I am only familiar with the rules I learned when I was in a kid, there appears to be a great deal of similarity with the board game 'checkers'.

At this point, there are only two files:
1. dame.h: Located in the Headers folder, which creates the various classes and structures needed for the basic implementation.
2. dame.cpp: Located in the Sources folder, which implements the classes and structures in dame.h
